# Horizon - Blog (based on Tyra)

A personal blog website just for fun.

Sometimes update articles and life moments on this site.

May just be browsed by net-spiders and whoever I invited.

v1.0

Contain basic function : publish articles, moments and mixes.
Redesigned Tyra UI and simplify the original funcions.
Like a Beta test so not invited many people.

v2.0

Add basic comment functions based on Waline.
Fix some annoying bugs and optimize the dependency pack.
Can be published broaderly now.
