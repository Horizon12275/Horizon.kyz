# My.Horizon4U.Red (based on ***Tyra***)

**A personal blog website just for fun.** 

*Sometimes* update articles and life moments on this site.

May just be browsed by net-spiders and whoever I invited.

## v1.0 (2023.9.10)

- Contain basic function : **publish articles, moments and mixes**.

- Redesigned Tyra UI and simplify the original funcions.

- Like *a Beta test* so not invited many people.

- Add basic **comment functions** based on Waline.

- Add Tech column.
